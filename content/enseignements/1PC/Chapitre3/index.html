<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Lately, one of the most exciting things you can say to me (at work) is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why aren’t people using X? What are the problems with X, and how can
we fix them?”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, I know these answers already by heart,
because I have lived and breathed X. This is how blogdown was for me -
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/476">I felt very tuned in to the usability problems
there</a>, and had <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/525">good
ideas for how to resolve
them</a>.</p>
<p>Other times, I have not used X (yet!). This happened to me recently when
I was asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why aren’t people using reveal.js for slides with R
Markdown? What are the problems with reveal.js, and how can we fix
them?”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is reveal.js? Here is a demo deck:</p>
<iframe src="https://revealjs.com/demo/" width="672" height="400px" data-external="1">
</iframe>
<p>It’s possible you’ve heard or seen reveal.js before - and it didn’t look this good! It may have looked more like this:</p>
<p>This…never quite worked for me. If you know my work, you know I’m a pretty big fan of the
<a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan">xaringan package</a> by <a href="https://yihui.org/">Yihui
Xie</a> for making HTML-based slides with R Markdown.
That package wraps a third-party JavaScript library called
<a href="https://github.com/gnab/remark">remark.js</a> and lets you use that to
knit R code and its output into your remark.js slides. I’ve used
xaringan for <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/talk/">years</a>, and have taught it
quite a lot too. It helps me make slides like this:</p>
<div class="shareagain" style="min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;">
<iframe src="https://alison.netlify.app/ares-kind-tools/#1" width="1600" height="900" style="border:2px solid currentColor;" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>
</div>
<p>I love it, but also recognize that <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-presentations-for-beginners/1222">it is
hard</a>,
and that it is not intended for beginners (hence the “ninja” references
in the package name and supporting documentation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is too bad, because I think HTML-based slides are a great way for beginners to get started using R Markdown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we are! Why aren’t people using reveal.js? I set out to find
out, and thought this was a great example of one of the things I love
most about being a Product Manager. Since I am not a current user, but
would conceivably be a target user, I get to play the part of the
“wide-eyed doe in the woods” - eager to learn but also a little cautious - will reveal.js cause me pain? It is likely</p>
<p>Plus, since it has been almost 6 months since my last blog post, I thought I would turn this early research project into a blog post to give a glimpse of some of the daily work I do as the Product Manager for Data Science Communication at RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="goal" class="section level2">
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Understand how users experience using reveal.js to make slides, and
identify areas for improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-competition" class="section level2">
<h2>The competition</h2>
<p>The landscape of HTML slide-making is unfortunately pretty big, but it’s important to sketch it out. There
are lots of frameworks, largely based off of different JavaScript tools.
I see almost a new one a month! If you just look at Pandoc alone, it
supports <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#slide-shows">five different
frameworks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://paulrouget.com/dzslides/">DZSlides</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/">Slidy</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://goessner.net/articles/slideous/">Slideous</a>, or</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gnab/remark">Remark.js</a> is another popular one, as I
mentioned earlier. There is also
<a href="https://webslides.tv/#slide=1">Webslides</a>. And
<a href="https://sli.dev/">Slidev</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/shower/shower">Shower</a>. And <a href="https://marp.app">Marp</a>. And more I’m sure! (In fact, here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/johnloy/27dd124ad40e210e91c70dd1c24ac8c8">gist</a> with more.)</p>
<p>The rmarkdown package also supports
<a href="https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/ioslides_presentation.html">ioslides</a>
as an output format.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-reveal.js" class="section level2">

<div id="research-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Research questions</h2>
<p>Given all these pluses, and the competition, what do we want to know/</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[Functionality]</code> How, if at all, do users expect to use reveal.js?
What problems does it solve for them, and what are unaddressed
problems?</li>
<li><code>[Ease of use]</code> Where, if at all, do users express uncertainty,
frustration, or confusion? What API problems arise?</li>
<li><code>[Task success]</code> What kinds of messages, warnings, or errors do
users encounter when using reveal.js? Where, if at all, do they get
stuck or confused? What, if any, strategies or resources do they
find for troubleshooting?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level2">
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>With these goals in mind, I wanted to start with just a few days of work, because I couldn’t tell how big of a project this was. So I didn’t want to do user interviews.</p>
<p>Instead, I relied on combing through community forums, blog posts,
existing documentation, and GitHub issues to trace the outline of the
problem space first. I actually got a lot of mileage from this exercise,
even without direct user input.</p>
<p>Here were some of my primary research resources (GitHub issues I tracked
inline with my notes below):</p>

<p>This kind of research is sort of akin to bushwhacking. There is no clear trail, and you are traveling in sort of wild country. There may be lots of noise in all these channels that actually isn’t accurate, so you have to trust your own intuition some and do your own testing even more.</p>
<p>I’ll note here that a red flag right off the bat for me is that we don’t even have revealjs tagged on <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/search?q=revealjs">RStudio Community</a>, so we aren’t exactly advertising usage. Nevertheless, there are questions about it on there, which seem to largely go unanswered. I also didn’t find a lot of blog posts or meetup presentations on the topic. If you know the #rstats community, you know that sharing knowledge is basically baked in, so this tells you <em>something</em> is up (but it could be messaging - the tool may still be great!).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-works" class="section level2">
<h2>What works?</h2>
<p>Before reading through many of the blog posts and community forum
threads, I also actually just used the tool.</p>
<p>Here was my minimal demo deck:</p>
<iframe src="https://revealing-slides.netlify.app/#/title-slide" width="672" height="400px" data-external="1">
</iframe>
<p>I tried to follow the docs myself, and maintain a <a href="https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/friction-logs">friction log</a> of what worked well and what didn’t. If I stumbled, I tried to make a mental note to actually figure out why at some point. It could be an actual bug, or it could be that my mental model is wrong, or it could be that I trusted a doc or a user’s guide and that led me astray. Whatever it is, it’s important that I track what went wrong. Here is my scratchpad of what I tried that <strong>did</strong> work.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Multi-column layout (but, a bit clunky? Have to create container first. In xaringan, this is just <code>.pull-left[contents...]</code> and <code>.pull-right[contents...]</code>)</p>
<pre class="md"><code>:::: {.columns} 
::: {.column width=&quot;40%&quot;} 
contents… 
::: 
::: {.column width=&quot;60%&quot;} 
contents… 
::: 
::::</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Tile view: <kbd>escape</kbd> kbd shortcut - very cool!</p>
<ul>
<li>Although why does tile view show all top aligned slides instead
of centered?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Vertical slides: Aha you invoke vertical slides by using level 1
headers! (essentially, by adding sections). The “default” horizontal
slide layout depends on using <code>##</code> for all slide headers - a bit of a
gotcha to folks so we’ll need to really document and teach this well</p>
<ul>
<li>Pandoc’s docs on this:
<strong>Note: in reveal.js slide shows, if slide
level is 2, a two-dimensional layout will be produced, with
level-1 headings building horizontally and level-2 headings
building vertically. It is not recommended that you use deeper
nesting of section levels with reveal.js.</strong></li>
<li>The option for vertical is actually nice- several customers have
mentioned to me that they like it for making flexible
presentations (i.e., if you have 5 min, you do just the
horizontal, if you have 20 you know you can go down and use the
vertical)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Speaker notes + <code>s</code> kbd shortcut for speaker view- nice, awesome</p>
<pre class="md"><code>::: notes 
This is my note.

-   It can contain Markdown

-   like this list 
:::</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Hidden slides- nice, awesome</p>
<pre class="md"><code>## {visibility=&quot;hidden&quot;}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Cool layout options: <a href="https://revealjs.com/layout/" class="uri">https://revealjs.com/layout/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Backgrounds for individual slides- images, transitions, all per slide, all work great (but! see the <code>oof</code> below regarding relative vs absolute image paths on GH pages)</p>
<pre class="md"><code>## CSS color bg {background=#ff0000}

## Full size image bg {background=&quot;background.jpeg&quot;}

## Video bg {background-video=&quot;background.mp4&quot;}

## A bg html page {background-iframe=&quot;https://example.com&quot;}</code></pre></li>

<div id="my-final-answer" class="section level2">
<h2>My final answer</h2>
<p>So the question I started with was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why aren’t people using reveal.js for slides with R
Markdown? What are the problems with reveal.js, and how can we fix
them?”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My answer? I think there are a few factors working against reveal.js. The most obvious is that there is a noticeable lack of community engagement around the format - so there is an enthusiasm gap there between reveal.js and R packages like xaringan. The sheer number of options for HTML-based slide output formats leads folks toward using the one they see and hear about in the wild. That often starts with brave sharers on social media like Twitter, which then trickles down into user blog posts, folks who can answer questions on community, and ultimately contributors who improve the open-source software themselves. There have been amazing community contributions around the xaringan ecosystem. Have you heard of: <a href="https://xaringan.club/" class="uri">https://xaringan.club/</a> (brought to you by <a href="https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/">Garrick</a>)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The first rule of xaringan club is…we talk about xaringan.”</em></p>

<p>Will there be a reveal.js club? I hope so! In my research, I found a lot of things to like working with reveal.js, and some things that I do think would serve R Markdown users and especially beginners well, perhaps even better than xaringan/remark.js. But, is there room for improvement? Always :wink:</p>
<p>Honestly, with slide making tools, my own experience is that I’m less enthusiastic when I feel less empowered. I feel empowered as a user when a tool lets me customize the look and layout of my slides, with some guardrails to make sure I don’t enter the deep-dark CSS labyrinth. What I want is to fall into the “pit of beauty” more quickly, instead of the “pit of ugly” after hours of trying. See this interview with Hadley Wickham about the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2017/12/05/problem-solving-pits-of-success.html">“pit of success”</a> if you don’t get this reference! In my experience, this is what will drive some brave adopters to dip their toe into reveal.js, and ultimately what might help teams take the plunge together.</p>
<p>So what happens next? This was just the beginning, but it is where I’m at after a few days of research and testing. I know I’ll be using it for my next slide deck so stay tuned!
